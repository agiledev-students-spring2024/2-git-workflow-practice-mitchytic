[A Brief History of the U.S. Trying to Add Backdoors Into Encrypted Data](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/a-brief-history-of-the-nsa-attempting-to-insert-backdoors-into-encrypted-data)

## Summary
This article talks about how the United States Government has historically tried to pry into data through the years. The points brought up by the article are interesting and a bit funny because they show how the NSA have brazenly, almost in a comedic way, put in back doors into consumer level electronics to try to spy on us. The article brings up examples such as Dual_EC_DRBG, a random number generation algorithm used in by computer security companies, or 'Clipper Chips' which were supposed to be a secure standard for protecting private communications while still allowing law enforcement to access it in certain scenarios. In both of these cases, the NSA created backdoors that essentially gave them full access of the systems while plugging their ears, closing their eyes, and claiming otherwise when questioned on it. 

The right to privacy should be guaranteed not only in our lives outside technology, but also within. Such attempts to create "backdoors" to pry our data must be put to a stop. -Yujin Hong
